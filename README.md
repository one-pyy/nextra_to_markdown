# nextra_to_markdown
Transform the entire Nextra project into a markdown file. Only tested with the `Prompt Engineering Guide` project...

I found the project *Prompt Engineering Guide*, but I can't understand English, so I want to hand it over to LLM for translation. Therefore, I tried to find a way to compile all the files into one markdown file but couldn't find one, so I wrote it myself. However, now I realize that writing a project that reads the corresponding documents and automatically sends them to LLM would be much better.
